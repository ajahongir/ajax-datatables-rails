  "body": "## Welcome to ajax-datatables-rails.\r\nDataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, based upon the foundations of progressive enhancement, and will add advanced interaction controls to any HTML table. For more details loot at home [page](https://datatables.net/)\r\nThis gem fully supports DataTables behavior and easily integrates to rails app. No more need to wrire js or rb code, just setup your model datatable. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis gem is based on DataTables idiom so It fully supports DataTable.\r\n\r\n## How-to project\r\nI always build admin page with some data presenting and I love to use DataTable in my projects. But Its to hard to build so many table with server-side pagination, ordering & searching. But now we have this tool! And Today I am going to show usage of this gem with a super easy [pattern](https://github.com/ajahongir/ajax-datatables-rails-v-0-4-0-how-to).\r\n\r\n## Basic usage\r\n### Gemfile\r\n`gem 'jquery-datatables-rails', github: 'github.com/ajahongir/ajax-datatables-rails', branch: 'v-0-4-0'`\r\n`gem 'ajax-datatables-rails'`\r\n\r\n### Advanced usage with a super easy pattern\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
